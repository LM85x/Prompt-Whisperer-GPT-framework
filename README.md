# Prompt-Whisperer-GPT-framework
OpenAI removed this popular GPT from the GPT store - so here is its framework


# Create a Custom GPT (Step-by-Step)

Make a focused, reusable version of ChatGPT with your own instructions, optional knowledge files, and tools (web, images, Actions). This guide follows OpenAI’s current builder flow.

---

## Prerequisites
- A ChatGPT account (Plus/Team/Enterprise recommended for building and sharing).
- A clear purpose (what it should do, for whom, with what tone).
- Optional: API endpoints you want to call via **Actions** (REST + OpenAPI schema).

---

## 1) Quick Start (Builder)
1. Open **ChatGPT** → **Explore GPTs** → **Create**.  
2. In the **Create** tab, describe your bot in natural language (the Builder drafts instructions).  
3. Switch to **Configure** to review and refine:
   - **Name & Description**
   - **Profile Image** (upload or generate)
   - **Instructions** (system-style behavior: role, dos/don’ts)
   - **Conversation Starters**
   - **Knowledge** (optional files for retrieval)
   - **Tools**: web browsing, image generation, file uploads, **Actions** (see §4)
4. Test in the preview chat (iterate on instructions/knowledge/tools).

---

## 2) Writing Great Instructions
- Keep the **role** and **goals** up front (1–3 sentences).
- List allowed tasks, required formats, and boundaries.
- Add short, concrete **examples** (I/O pairs).
- Prefer **simple, modular rules** over long prose.
- Note style (tone, language, brevity) and refusal policy.

> Tip: Start minimal. Ship v1, watch failure modes, then refine.

---

## 3) Knowledge (Optional)
- Upload small, high-quality source docs (FAQs, policies, playbooks).  
- Keep files scoped to what users need; avoid PII.  
- Re-test after each update to ensure answers cite the right passages.

---

## 4) Actions (Optional, for APIs)
Use **Actions** to let your GPT call external services.

- Provide an **OpenAPI (JSON/YAML)** schema with auth.
- Configure auth (API key, OAuth, etc.).
- **Verify the domain** and include a **Privacy Policy URL** if your action calls an external API.
- Add clear user-facing summaries (“What this action does, when it runs, what data is sent”).

> Ship with least privilege: narrow endpoints, short timeouts, explicit parameter ranges.

---

## 5) Data & Privacy
- Conversations with GPTs may be used to improve models unless you **opt out in Settings → Data Controls**.
- For Actions, send only what’s needed (minimize request payloads); disclose third-party data handling.
- If your GPT processes sensitive data, document it (what, why, retention) and provide a contact channel.

---

## 6) Testing Checklist
- **Instruction-following**: edge cases, ambiguous prompts, wrong-format inputs.
- **Safety/compliance**: refusal behavior; avoids disallowed topics.
- **Knowledge grounding**: cites/uses uploaded docs correctly.
- **Actions**: rate limits, error messages, auth expiry, sandbox data.
- **UX polish**: starters, description, icon, example prompts.

---

## 7) Share & Publish
- **Private**: just for you.
- **Link**: anyone with the link.
- **Publish**: visible in the Store (follow policy & quality bars).
  - If using external Actions: ensure domain verification + Privacy Policy URL.
  - Prepare a crisp About page (value prop, examples, limitations).

---

## 8) Maintenance & Versioning
- Track changes to instructions/knowledge.
- Re-test Actions when APIs change (versions, scopes).
- Monitor user feedback and update starters/examples.
- Keep a CHANGELOG in this repo.
